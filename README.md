# Cross-Domain Patterns of Discourse Segmentation

The xml-text.py file is a script that takes XML files (specifically those from PubMed Central) and produces a collection of TXT files for use in discourse segmentation and parsing. This process is works using Beautiful Soup 4.6.0, and requires the specification of an input and output directory.

I have also provided the EDU files that contain the segmentation of the sections used as gold data in my analysis. In these files, the EDUs are separated by line.

The following paper provides context for the code and documents:
